                        To build this application, I used the Spring Boot framework for an easy setup.<br>
                        I also used the Spring Security module to add authentication and authorization
                        mechanisms.<br>
                        To maintain user data and classroom table entries, I used MySQL database together with
                        JPA.<br>
                        And for the frontend I used Thymeleaf to create a user-friendly interface for the
                        CRUD operations.

                        This was one of the first backend projects I developed using Java, so there were a
                        lot of things, like frameworks and modules, that I did not know anything about.
                        <br><br>
                        Security and authorization were the main problems I had to deal with, 
                        establishing what a user can and cannot access and how to 
                        implement this was both as problematic as challenging, and ended up being fun.
                        <br><br>
                        But in the end, through documentation and online tutorials I was able to finish 
                        create this application that I really enjoyed developing.

                        The project can be extended and have more capabilities,

                        <ul>
                            <li>Deciding how a user can have access to write operations(it could be by username

                            <li>New tables related to the classroom table can be added so that more information
                                can be seen.
